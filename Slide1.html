<b><i><p>In general, a vegetable refers to the edible parts of plants, including roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits, 
that are typically eaten as part of a meal, often as a savory dish.</p></b></i><hr>
<h2>*IMPORTANCE OF VEGETABLES*</h2></center>
<p>Vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet because they are a rich source
of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. These nutrients help prevent illness and keep your body healthy.
Vegetable is a broad term that refers to a group of plants that you can eat. You may be able to eat
the whole plant or just parts, such as the leaves, stalk, and seeds. In general, vegetables are low
in calories but high in nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They’re also high in natural
chemical compounds called antioxidants that can help protect your cells from damage.Health experts 
recommend that you eat several servings of vegetables each day. Research shows that eating a balanced
diet rich in plant foods is one of the best ways to boost your health.</p>
<p>Fruit and vegetables are a good source of vitamins and minerals, including folate, vitamin C and
potassium. They're an excellent source of dietary fibre, which can help to maintain a healthy gut
and prevent constipation and other digestion problems. A diet high in fibre can also reduce your risk
of bowel cancer.</p><hr>
